# Test Document for Upload

## Introduction
This is a test document to demonstrate the document upload functionality in MAI Storage.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the algorithm can make predictions on new, unseen data.

Key characteristics:
- Uses labeled training data
- Learns input-output mappings
- Can be used for classification and regression tasks
- Examples: Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns and structures. The algorithm tries to discover the underlying structure of the data without being told what to look for.

Key characteristics:
- Uses unlabeled data
- Discovers hidden patterns
- No predefined correct answers
- Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Applications include:
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Game playing (like AlphaGo)

## RAG Systems

### Traditional RAG
Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems work in a simple three-step process:
1. **Retrieve**: Find relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base
2. **Augment**: Combine the retrieved information with the user's query
3. **Generate**: Use a language model to produce a response based on the augmented context

### Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG systems add intelligence and multi-step reasoning to the traditional approach:
- **Planning**: Break down complex queries into sub-questions
- **Verification**: Check the quality and relevance of retrieved information
- **Refinement**: Iterate on the search and generation process
- **Self-correction**: Identify and fix potential errors or gaps

Benefits of Agentic RAG:
- Better handling of complex, multi-part questions
- Higher accuracy through verification steps
- More comprehensive answers
- Improved citation quality

## Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for modern AI applications.

### Key Features
- **Similarity Search**: Find vectors that are similar to a query vector
- **Indexing**: Efficient data structures like HNSW for fast retrieval
- **Scalability**: Handle millions or billions of vectors
- **Real-time Updates**: Support for adding, updating, and deleting vectors

### Popular Vector Databases
- **Qdrant**: Open-source vector database with excellent performance
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database service
- **Weaviate**: Open-source vector search engine
- **Chroma**: Lightweight vector database for AI applications

## Conclusion
This document covers essential concepts in machine learning, RAG systems, and vector databases. It provides a good foundation for testing document upload and retrieval capabilities in AI systems.
