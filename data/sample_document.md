# Sample Document for Phase 2 Testing

## Introduction
This is a sample document to test the MAI Storage Phase 2 hybrid retrieval system.

## Python Programming
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Data Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains.

## Conclusion
This document covers multiple topics related to programming, AI, and data science, making it ideal for testing semantic search capabilities.
