By following these steps, you can create a robust CI/CD pipeline that not only addresses the needs of a microservices architecture but also prioritizes security and performance.","[{'content': 'Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying software:\n\nCI Pipeline Components\n\nBuild automation: Compile and package code\n\nAutomated testing: Run test suites on every commit\n\nCode quality...', 'doc_id': '51ce1058-ff73-45a4-9df0-e5ab02b8d7fe', 'score': 0.1297753006219864, 'title': 'software_engineering_practices.md'}, {'content': 'Integration tests: Test component interactions\n\nEnd-to-end tests: Test complete user workflows\n\nTest-Driven Development (TDD)\n\nWrite failing test\n\nWrite minimal code to pass\n\nRefactor while keeping te...', 'doc_id': '4efa6a24-4ebd-4949-84ee-c9562276737b', 'score': 0.028752973303198814, 'title': 'software_engineering_practices.md'}, {'content': 'Visual workflow: Board showing work states\n\nWork-in-progress limits: Constrain concurrent work\n\nContinuous improvement: Regular process optimization\n\nMicroservices Architecture\n\nDesigning distributed ...', 'doc_id': 'd41f5c15-ab44-472e-bf5f-912ba07b4182', 'score': 0.00473029725253582, 'title': 'software_engineering_practices.md'}, {'content': 'Pair programming\n\nAutomated code analysis\n\nReview checklists\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\nStrategies for improving application performance:\n\nProfiling and Monitoring\n\nApplication Performance Monitoring ...', 'doc_id': '07e22bf4-f830-4ad4-8b87-e473e1ecb722', 'score': 0.00038919548387639225, 'title': 'software_engineering_practices.md'}, {'content': 'Rolling updates: Replace instances incrementally\n\nFeature flags: Toggle features without code changes\n\nCode Review Process\n\nSystematic approach to maintaining code quality:\n\nReview Guidelines\n\nFocus o...', 'doc_id': 'a499b873-5b75-4c89-8f4b-e7348b1e78a8', 'score': 0.00037211779272183776, 'title': 'software_engineering_practices.md'}]",9671.918153762817,1051,892.0929431915283,,,,,,,,traditional,2025-08-12T15:06:10.114577,
