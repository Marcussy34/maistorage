18,How does the document describe testing semantic search?,"The document mentions that it covers multiple topics related to programming, AI, and data science, which makes it ideal for testing semantic search capabilities. This suggests that the diverse content is leveraged to evaluate how effectively a semantic search system can retrieve relevant information based on various subject matters [Source: doc_name, chunk_index]. 

However, specific details on the methodology or criteria for testing semantic search are not provided in the context documents.","[{'content': 'Data Science\n\nData science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and ap...', 'doc_id': 'a7d65985-aa29-4ead-8ce5-e40b43aa7dce', 'score': 0.8772865533828735, 'title': 'sample_document.md'}, {'content': 'Sample Document for Phase 2 Testing\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a sample document to test the MAI Storage Phase 2 hybrid retrieval system.\n\nPython Programming\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programmi...', 'doc_id': 'f61b937e-df42-4461-9818-c7e525d399de', 'score': 0.0021024993620812893, 'title': 'sample_document.md'}, {'content': 'Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
