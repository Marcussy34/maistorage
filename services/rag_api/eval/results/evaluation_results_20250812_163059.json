In contrast, transformers utilize a multi-head attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, computing attention weights for all input positions in parallel, which is a significant departure from the sequential processing nature of RNNs [Source: advanced_ml_concepts.md, chunk 1/10].\n\nFor a complete comparison, additional information would be required beyond what is provided in the context.",
