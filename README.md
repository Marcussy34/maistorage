### What this project is
A focused effort to build a practical, demo-ready assistant that answers questions about your documents with transparent evidence and a simple chat experience.

### What it does
- Answers questions using your own content and shows exactly where each answer came from (citations)
- Plans, verifies, and refines answers when needed to reduce mistakes (agentic loop)
- Streams responses in a clean chat UI for a fast, natural feel
- Lets you compare traditional vs agentic RAG so differences are visible
- Tracks quality with a small evaluation set and improves iteratively
- Tunes for speed and cost without sacrificing clarity
- Keeps setup and usage straightforward
